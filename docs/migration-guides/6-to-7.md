# Upgrading from 6.X to 7.X

The main change between 6.X & 7.X is that the library was entirely ported to Typescript.
There are only a couple of breaking changes to make the different modules more consistent.

## Node Transform signature has changed to switch the order of the arguments

To have more consistent signature with the whatwg module, the Node Transform arguments order has been changed.

```js
import { NodeAsyncParser } from 'json2csv';

// Json2csv options, node's Transform options
const parser = new NodeAsyncParser(opts, transformOpts, asyncOpts);
```

now should be:

```js
import { NodeAsyncParser } from 'json2csv';

// Json2csv options, streamparser/json options, node's Transform options
const parser = new NodeAsyncParser(opts, {}, transformOpts);
```

If you only use the standard options, no changes are needed.
But, if you use the async options or the transform options, you need to ensure that you use them in the right order.

The added benefit is that you have more control over how the JSON data is parsed.

## Node Async Parser signature has changed to accept async options

To have more consistent signature with the Transform and the whatwg module, the Node Async Parser now accepts 3 arguments.

```js
import { NodeTransform } from 'json2csv';

// Json2csv options, node's Transform options, , streamparser/json options
const parser = new NodeAsyncParser(opts, transformOpts, asyncOpts);
```

now should be:

```js
import { NodeAsyncParser } from 'json2csv';

// Json2csv options, streamparser/json options, node's Transform options
const parser = new NodeTransform(opts, {}, transformOpts);
```

If you only use the standard options, no changes are needed.
But, if you use the transform options, you need to add an empty object.

The added benefit is that you have more control over how the JSON data is parsed.
